# Who am I?

Hello! I'm Metroman, I started in 2020 with this identity on the Internet, it all started with the initiative to build the Metro in BTE Chile when I carried one of my thousands of names "FGY Games", thanks to a partner (currently inactive) from that Discord server I ended up adopting my final name: MetroMan. Don't ask me if there will be copyright problems, I don't even know, but I'm currently dedicating myself to organizing my life preparing for what may be my future: Social Networks and Translation. That's why here you have an improved version of my old website, with a custom domain and everything.

Expelled from BTE Chile during November 2024, I will soon comment on what I will do now with my Social Networks, in the meantime I am putting together a Conlang on a Discord Server: [Here you can enter](https://discord.gg/8NPsyq7rp7)
