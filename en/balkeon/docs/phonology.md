# Phonology in Balkeon

Pronouncing and speaking Balkeon is not that difficult, the words are pronounced as they are read.

## Letters

### Vowels

Including the written and spoken form, there are 5 vowels: `a, e, i, o, u`, all pronounceable as in Esperanto or Spanish (or, if you don't know either such language, as in the vowels in the English words "mark" (without the R), "bet", "green", British "pot" (in US English this is instead the vowel in "north", again without the R), "boom"); when speaking a secret "epenthetic" vowel can be included, the [*schwa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa). Its pronunciation is similar to that of some unstressed vowels in English, being for Balkeon a wildcard to break up overly long strings of consonants.

**Examples of use:**

- Tutfosin, tutfaum
- Always, anyway

In these examples we have the letter `T` and the letter `F`, which when together can cause problems when speaking, with the vowel *schwa* (we will represent it as **…ô**) it would be like this:

- Tut…ôfosin, tut…ôfaum

### Consonants

There are 15 consonants, here is the list:

- B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, Y.

With the consonants the only issue would be the `C` that never appears alone, but accompanied by the `H`. All of these sounds save one exist in English, as well as in Esperanto (if you are familiar with that).

`S` appears both alone and in combination with `SH`, which is the same sound at the start of English "share"

In case you need to know, the IPA for Y is: [ ù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%9E%B2). *That is an average Spanish ll/y. Without causing confusion, though technically wrong, it is also possible to use the English Y in "yes"*

### Affricates

In Balkeon there is only 1: `ch`, which is roughly but not exactly equivalent to `t` and `sh` combined, or the same sound at the start of English "chair".

In case you need to know, the IPA for these is: [tÕ° É](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate) and  É

# Phonotactics

- Balkeon is quite free with its rules, however it still has its restrictions.

- Triphthongs should never appear; if a triphthong is formed by combining two roots they must be separated using the wildcard `r`.

- In 99% of cases no word can begin with `s` or `l` if the consonant following is also a consonant, this includes consonants such as `b, d, h, k, p, t, y` plus any combination that can be made between them (`bd`, `hk`, `kh`). There are less than 10 roots with these exceptions, as well as the pronouns such as "saye".

- Adding to this it is common practice that any word borrowed from another language beginning in one of these combinations should either be simplified to a single consonant or have `e` added if appropriate) e.g. `espokeon`.

- When converting a loanword to Balkeon and it ends in a vowel, `r` can be added to place the appropriate suffix.

- This is useful for converting Proper Names to Balkeon. 

- Two similar sounding consonants cannot go together, e.g. `kh`, `bp` when born of etymology, one of the two is cancelled.

- [Plurals](../../grammar/words/#plurals) have their own rules detailed in that section.
